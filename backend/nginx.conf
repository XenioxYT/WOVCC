# Template Nginx reverse-proxy config for WOVCC.
# IMPORTANT:
# - This template intentionally does NOT include Privacy Sandbox directives in Permissions-Policy.
#   Browsers will warn on unknown / origin-trial-controlled features like:
#   browsing-topics, run-ad-auction, join-ad-interest-group, private-aggregation, attribution-reporting, etc.
# - If you currently see those warnings, they are coming from your *proxy/CDN*, not from the Flask app.
